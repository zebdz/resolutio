1. Joining organization - This list should not contain organizations that a user is already a member of. Also, it should not contain organizations that a user already requested to join and is pending approval. So, only organizations that a user is not a member of and did not request to join yet should be shown in the list of organizations to join.
2. Creating organization - At the time of creation, this parent organization can be chosen. However, a list of parent organization candidates should only contain organizations, which the current user is admin of. So, anybody cannot just create a child organization of some organization that they are not admin of. To create a child organization, one have to be an admin of a parent organization. The list of parent organization candidates should be a searchable select.

3. Accepting a user to an organization
- only an admin of the organization that a user requested to join, can handle this request to join
- an admin can reject a request - supplying an optional rejection reason 
- user's home should have a list of organizations that:
	- they are a member of
	- they requested to join
	- they were rejected to join (with rejection reason if supplied)
- upon admin's accepting/rejecting a user's organizations' list should be updated
- so, an admin should have a route/page that only he/she can access (and visible only to he/she) that will contain:
	- list of pending requests to join the organization (user name, user phone, date requested ascending)
	- accept/reject button (with rejection reason input)
	- as this admin can be and admin of multiple organizations, this list should be grouped by an organization
	- when they accept/reject we need to save the info: accepted_at (or rejected_at), rejection reason (not required), user_id of an admin that accepted/rejected

- Use TDD approach.
- as always, write tests first, then implement the functionality
